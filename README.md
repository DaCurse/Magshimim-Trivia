This is the source code for my final project for my 2nd year in Magshimim (2019). 

It was initially hosted on Gitlab, now I am gradually moving some projects to GitHub and archiving them. 

For this project, we've been given a UML, state machine and more guidelines on how to build each version of this project. This repo has implementation up to version 2.0.0 which supports adding rooms and having users join rooms. Most of the source code can be found in the [develop](https://github.com/DaCurse/Magshimim-Trivia/tree/develop) branch.
